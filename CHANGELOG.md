# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Explore screen header decluttered** — the search bar and group-filter chip row are now hidden by default. Tap the AppBar lens icon to slide in the search field, or the filter icon to reveal the chip row. A small dot on the filter icon indicates when a non-default group filter is active. Toggling one collapses the other so only one control is visible at a time.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Explore screen species search** — search field at the top of the Explore screen runs over the full audio-model species list, not only the geo-filtered subset. Matches are split into "At your location" and "Other species" sections so distant species (e.g. Blue Jay or Gray Wolf in Europe) can still be opened to view their info card.
- **Explore taxonomic group filter** — horizontal chip row to restrict the list to All / Birds / Mammals / Amphibians / Insects. Filter applies to both the geo-likely list and the search results.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Session review species search** — search now matches localized common names (German, French, Spanish, Czech, Italian, Portuguese), not only English. Results are ranked by text relevance: full-string prefix > word prefix > substring, with observation count as a tie-breaker. Geo-likely species are softly boosted but never demoted from a strong text match.
- **Multi-token search** — typing multiple words (e.g. "barn owl") now correctly matches species containing all tokens in any order.

### Changed

- **Add/Replace species overlay redesign** — when invoked from "Replace this detection" on a specific cluster, the picker now shows a banner with the detection being replaced (thumbnail, common name, scientific name) and skips the redundant mode selector and dropdown — the user only chooses the new species.
- **Add species (FAB)** — defaults to "Insert at playback position" (the more useful mode) and drops the unused "Replace" segment from this entry path.
- **Result tiles** include a 48×48 species thumbnail.
- **Empty / no-result states** — clear hint when the search field is empty (with "Unknown / Other" surfaced as a quick action) and a friendly "no results" message when nothing matches.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Spectrogram render quality is now user-configurable (Low / Medium / High) under Settings → Spectrogram, with High as the default for sharp live spectrograms and Low as a fallback for older phones
- Survey foreground notification now uses a monochrome blue jay silhouette as the status-bar small icon instead of a generic circle
- Species info overlay opens to the user's locale Wikipedia page when bundled (interface locales: en, de, fr, es, cs, pt, it), falling back to English

### Changed
- Default visible spectrogram duration raised from 15 s to 20 s for a wider live view
- Live and Point Count spectrograms render with the configured filter quality (was hardcoded low) for noticeably crisper detail when upscaled
- Session review spectrogram now uses FFT 2048 + high filter quality for sharper detection-clip previews
- Live mode keeps the recording running across pause so audio and detection timestamps remain continuous; detections are now timestamped at the start of the analyzed window for accurate review playback
- Recording capture uses a unified clip-context setting and now captures true pre+post audio around each detection
- Survey detection markers only show the play badge when the audio clip actually exists on disk; markers gain a stronger audio affordance (accent ring, larger badge, grey border for silent markers)
- Tapping the active play button in session review now pauses playback (works for both Live and Survey clips)
- Species info overlay now uses fully bundled taxonomy data — eBird link is shown only when an `ebird_code` exists (insects and other non-birds correctly hide it), iNaturalist only when an `inat_id` exists, and Wikipedia only when a bundled URL exists for the active locale
- eBird link chip uses the Cornell Lab sapsucker silhouette as its icon
- German UI uses "Detektion" / "Detektionen" instead of "Erkennung" / "Erkennungen" throughout for clearer detection terminology

### Fixed
- Survey detection clip player honors the pause toggle (previously kept playing when tapping the active play button)

### Privacy / Hardening
- Verified the app makes no network calls beyond OSM map tiles and OSM Nominatim reverse geocoding (both gated by a single one-time consent); no taxonomy API, no analytics, no telemetry
- Removed the unused `cached_network_image` dependency and dead taxonomy-API URL helpers (`thumbUrl` / `mediumUrl` getters and the static API base URL) so future code cannot accidentally reintroduce taxonomy-API fetches

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Survey map markers now show a small play badge on detections whose audio clip was retained, making it visually obvious which icons can be played back
- Tapping a marker with audio opens a modal player overlay with a spectrogram preview, scrubber, and play/pause controls (replaces the old silent in-place playback)

### Changed
- Smart sampling: same-spot distance threshold reduced from 500 m to 250 m and a per-species minimum of 3 retained clips is always honored — the first three high-confidence detections of a species always survive, even when they share a spot
- Survey foreground notification now refreshes about once per second so the lock-screen timer matches actual recording time (session disk persistence stays on its 30 s cadence)
- Survey "elapsed" / total recorded time now excludes pause/resume gaps. `LiveSession` persists `recordedDurationSeconds`; resumed sessions accumulate active time across segments instead of measuring wall-clock from the original start
- Detection map widget prefers audio-bearing detections when collapsing duplicates at the same location so the play badge is accurate
- "Smart" sampling label kept untranslated across all locales (was "Intelligent" / "Inteligente" / etc.) to prevent layout overflow on narrow devices

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Onboarding pages use a more compact layout (smaller icons, smaller title, tighter padding) so the Terms & Privacy page — including the Privacy Policy link — fits on one screen on compact devices

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Onboarding dots indicator no longer overflows on narrow displays now that the carousel has 6 pages (smaller dot size, tighter spacing, narrower active dot)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Onboarding screens now use smaller icons and reduced top padding to prevent overflow on compact displays
- Terms of Use and Privacy Policy text (onboarding gate and Terms step) updated to reflect that both map tiles and reverse geocoding share a single one-time consent
- User-facing copy made taxonomically agnostic across all 7 locales — replaced "bird species", "bird identification", "bird detection", and "bird calls" with "species", "species identification", "detection", and "animal calls" respectively (the app supports more than birds)
- Terms gate now also explicitly forbids use for poaching, illegal wildlife trade, and military purposes, matching the published Terms of Use

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Point Count setup now collects a custom name and observer name (parity with Survey); observer is remembered across sessions
- Onboarding gained a dedicated Terms & Privacy step with deep links to the full Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
- Session auto-stop reasons (manual, duration, battery, storage) and ETA hints during long-running sessions
- Loading skeleton for species info while taxonomy data resolves
- Accessibility labels for live capture controls and confidence metrics; haptic feedback on selection changes
- Session review now tracks playback position and highlights the active detection window
- New shared `WizardScaffold` for multi-step setup wizards (Live, Point Count, Survey, File Analysis)
- Shared loading, error, empty-state, and confirmation-dialog widgets across the app
- `ScoreColors` theme extension providing a consistent five-step confidence color scale
- Settings help tooltips and expanded UI tooltips throughout the app
- JSON export now includes full session metadata (custom name, session number, observer, transect ID, distance, stop reason)
- Detection windows now record end timestamps (live and survey) for accurate review and export

### Changed
- Reverse geocoding is now gated by the same one-time consent prompt as map tiles (no requests to OpenStreetMap until the user approves)
- Detection sampling for surveys reworked with clearer logic, expanded test coverage, and improved documentation
- Map handling and location services hardened (permission flow, lifecycle, and error states)
- Survey finalization flow hardened against edge cases during cleanup
- Documentation updated to use Material Design icon names consistently

### Fixed
- Runtime cleanup edge cases on session stop and screen disposal
- Integration test warnings cleaned up

### Changed
- Localized remaining user-facing strings in file analysis, explore, settings, and survey notifications across all supported locales
- Updated Help guidance to point users to the User Guide from both Help and About
- Reworked Help and Explore guidance to explain app navigation and screen behavior rather than field methodology
- Localized the new help-overlay copy across all supported locales

### Changed
- File analysis step indicator now uses simple progress bars (matching point count and survey setup)
- Smart detection sampling reworked: uses distance (>500 m) and time (>2 min) thresholds instead of fixed spatial bins; keeps only the highest-scoring detection per species at each spot

## [0.3.1] â€” 2026-04-15

### Changed

## [0.2.10] â€” 2025-07-27

### Added
- Recording mode setting (Full / Detections only / Off) restored to settings screen as segmented button
- Detection clip playback in session review: when only detection clips were recorded (no full recording), play buttons play individual clips

## [0.2.9] â€” 2025-07-27

### Added
- Share/export button now available for survey sessions (CSV, JSON, GPX, Raven â€” audio optional)

### Fixed

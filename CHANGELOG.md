# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Privacy policy updated to reflect offline species data bundle and current data handling
- Terms of use now hosted on the documentation site (was GitHub markdown)

### Added
- Terms of Use page in mkdocs documentation
- User Guide link on the About screen

## [0.3.0] — 2025-07-28

### Added
- `Begin File` column in Raven selection tables for multi-file compatibility
- `File` column in CSV exports referencing the audio source
- Latitude / Longitude columns in Raven and CSV exports when detections have coordinates
- GPX file auto-included in survey ZIP bundles
- Species common name in detection clip filenames (e.g. `_clip_001_Eurasian_Blackbird.flac`)
- Custom session name included in export filenames
- JSON export now includes session type, location, and per-detection coordinates
- Export prefix `BirdNET_Live_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` for all exported files (display names unchanged)

### Fixed
- Detection timestamps in exports are always session-relative (no more 0-based times for clips)
- Survey share now correctly produces ZIP bundles with individual detection clips
- `manualGlobal` detection end time in CSV uses session duration (consistent with Raven builder)
- Removed unused local variable in `live_controller.dart`

### Changed
- Session display names no longer use `BirdNET_Live` prefix (cleaner in-app display)

## [0.2.10] — 2025-07-27

### Added
- Recording mode setting (Full / Detections only / Off) restored to settings screen as segmented button
- Detection clip playback in session review: when only detection clips were recorded (no full recording), play buttons play individual clips

### Fixed
- Survey sessions with "detections only" recording mode now surface audio clips correctly in session review
- Play buttons hidden in session review when no audio exists (recording mode was off)

## [0.2.9] — 2025-07-27

### Added
- Share/export button now available for survey sessions (CSV, JSON, GPX, Raven — audio optional)

### Fixed
- Survey sessions now always record full audio (like live sessions) so playback and trim work in review
- Recording mode default changed from "off" to "full" for live sessions (live controller already recorded full regardless)

### Changed
- Recording mode setting removed from general settings screen (only exposed in survey setup where it applies)
- Observer name and track distance shown in a single row in session review header
- Survey map in session review reduced from 25% to 18% of screen height

## [0.2.8] — 2025-07-27

### Added
- Offline species data bundle: 5,241 species images (240×160 WebP) and descriptions in 7 languages bundled into the APK
- `dev/build_species_bundle.py` — re-runnable Python build script to download, resize, and package species assets
- `SpeciesDescriptionService` — lazy gzip JSON loader with per-locale caching and English fallback
- Italian (`it`) and Korean (`ko`) common name columns added to `taxonomy.csv`

### Changed
- All species images now load from bundled assets instead of network (CachedNetworkImage → Image.asset)
- Species detail overlay uses bundled descriptions instead of taxonomy API fetch
- `TaxonomyService` is now fully offline — removed `fetchDetail()` and API cache

## [0.2.7] — 2025-07-27

### Added
- French (fr), Spanish (es), Czech (cs), Brazilian Portuguese (pt), and Italian (it) translations (~290 keys each)
- Language picker in settings expanded from 3 to 8 options (System, English, Deutsch, Français, Español, Čeština, Português, Italiano)
- Landscape layouts for Home, Live, Point Count, Survey Live, and Session Review screens
- Tablet max-width constraint (600 dp) applied to 8 screens via shared `ContentWidthConstraint` widget
- Comprehensive localization: ~40 new l10n keys covering settings labels, live screen status texts, detection list states, color map names, recording mode options, and microphone settings (English + German)
- German technical term consistency: Point Count, Survey, and Session kept in English across the German UI

### Changed
- Home screen footer: single `Wrap` with all 5 buttons replacing two-row layout
- Mode card descriptions rewritten as action-oriented phrases (English + German)
- Help text updated to be taxonomically agnostic ("species" instead of "bird species", "animal sounds" instead of "birdsong")

## [0.2.6] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- GPS jitter filtering: reject fixes with >30 m horizontal accuracy, speed gate (>30 km/h) discards teleport jumps, jitter threshold raised from 3 m to 5 m

### Changed
- Survey notification now shows species count alongside detections (“42 det · 12 spp”)

## [0.2.5] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- Microphone input selector in survey setup wizard (Parameters step) — pick input device before starting a survey
- Survey summary tab now shows rank numbers and sorts species by detection count then max confidence as tiebreaker

## [0.2.4] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- Help screen accessible from the home screen footer — comprehensive guide clustered by mode (Live, Point Count, Survey, File Analysis, Explore, Sessions) with expandable sections and general tips
- Home screen footer reorganized: 5 items in two rows (3 + 2) replacing the horizontal scroll

### Changed
- Inline survey map in session review is now interactive (pinch-zoom, pan, double-tap zoom) instead of static
- Deferred map `fitCamera` to post-frame callback to fix tiles not rendering until first touch

### Fixed
- Survey live help overlay with signal quality bar explanation and dashboard icons

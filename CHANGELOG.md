# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **The persistent survey notification now lists the three most recent detections**, each on its own line with the localized common name, confidence percentage, and a short relative timestamp (`just now`, `42s ago`, `5m ago`, `2h ago`). On Android the lines are visible as soon as the notification is expanded thanks to the underlying BigTextStyle, so you can glance at the lock screen mid-survey and see what's been heard most recently without unlocking the phone. Species names honor the user's species locale and the *Show scientific names* toggle, identical to the in-app cards.

### Added

- New ARB keys `surveySecondsAgo` and `surveyHoursAgo` (paired with the existing `surveyJustNow` / `surveyMinutesAgo`) so the relative timestamps in the notification render naturally in every supported language (en/de/cs/es/fr/it/pt).

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **Watchlist editor is now a real species picker.** Replaced the cramped paste-the-scientific-names dialog with a full-screen editor: a search field on top scans the entire taxonomy (matches scientific name, English common name, and every localized common name) and shows tappable checkbox results, while an *Import from file* button reads any `.txt`/`.csv` plain-text list of scientific names from device storage. The selected-species pane stays visible when you clear the search so it's obvious what's already in the list, and selections survive locale switches because friendly labels are cached at pick time.
- **Survey alert notifications now use a monochrome blue-jay icon** instead of a white square. Switched both `SpeciesAlertNotifier.init` and `requestPermission` to the existing `ic_notification` drawable that the foreground-service notification already uses, so the heads-up alert visually matches the persistent recording notification.
- **Cleaner alert text.** Notifications no longer repeat the species name twice (title and body both said it). The body is now just the reason — *"First detection of this survey"*, *"On your watchlist"*, *"Detected at this location with under 4% likelihood"*, etc. — keeping the species name in the bold notification title where Android renders it largest.
- **Localized notifications work end-to-end.** When the app delivers a species alert it now uses the user's selected species locale (and respects the *Show scientific names* toggle), so a German user sees *Kohlmeise* in the notification instead of *Great Tit*. The localizer plumbs through `SurveyAlertCoordinator` so it stays correct across coalesced summary alerts too.
- **German wording fix.** *Erkennung* in the alert bodies is now *Detektion*, matching the term used everywhere else in the German UI.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **Species-alerts wizard step is now a real, finished UX.** The setup screen for the new push alerts has been rebuilt: a *Minimum confidence* slider sits below the mode picker and is automatically floored to your session confidence threshold (alerts can never be more sensitive than the detections themselves). The advanced *Frequency control* section now uses one-tap chip selectors for startup grace (Off / 30 s / 1 m / 2 m / 5 m), minimum interval (Off / 5 / 15 / 30 / 60 s) and per-minute cap (1 / 3 / 5 / 10 / Unlimited) instead of free-form integer text fields. The rare-species slider gained a live readout — *"Alerts on species with under 5 % likelihood at this location."* — so you understand what the slider position will actually do before you start the survey. A help button in the step header opens an in-context bottom sheet explaining the alert modes and the throttling rules.
- **Watchlist creation and management directly in the wizard.** Previously the Watchlist alert mode was a dead end if you hadn't already created a list — and there was no way *anywhere* in the app to create one. The wizard now lists all saved watchlists as selectable tiles with a species count, lets you delete lists with a confirmation dialog, and exposes a *New watchlist* button that opens an inline editor for naming a list and pasting a block of scientific names (one per line) straight from your clipboard. Picking Watchlist mode without selecting a list now blocks the Next button with a clear inline error.

### Added

- **Notification-permission prompt on mode change.** Picking any non-Off alert mode in the wizard now triggers the Android notification-permission request the first time it's needed, so you don't have to remember to grant it from system settings before alerts can fire.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Push-style species alerts during surveys.** A new step in the survey setup wizard lets you choose when to receive a heads-up notification mid-survey: *Off* (default), *First in session* (one alert the first time each species is heard), *First ever* (alert only when the app encounters a species for the very first time across all your sessions — a "lifer" alert), *Rare for this location* (alert when the geo-model probability for the current location is below a configurable threshold, so a Black-throated Sparrow showing up in Bavaria gets your attention), or *Watchlist* (alert only on species you've added to a saved custom list). Alerts respect a configurable confidence floor and fire on a separate Android notification channel so you can mute them independently of the silent ongoing survey-recording notification.
- **Smart frequency control for alerts.** Real surveys often see a flurry of new species in the first few minutes — without throttling, the device would buzz constantly. The pipeline now applies three layered limits: a startup grace window (default 60 s) that suppresses *first-in-session* alerts at the start of a survey while still letting rare/watchlist alerts fire immediately, a hard minimum interval between any two alerts (default 15 s), and a sliding per-minute cap (default 3) with optional coalescing — over-cap alerts queue into a single summary notification ("3 more new species: ...") instead of being dropped. All limits are user-configurable from an *Advanced* section in the wizard.
- **Lifetime species history**, persisted in app preferences, powers the *First ever* mode. On first launch after upgrading, the app backfills the history from your existing session records so the very first survey under 0.7.0 doesn't fire a "lifer" for every common species you've already recorded.

## [0.6.9] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Every session export now ships with full provenance metadata.** ZIP bundles always include a `<prefix>.metadata.json` side-file alongside the audio and selection table, and JSON exports gain a top-level `meta` block. The metadata captures the app version and build number, the audio and geo model names/versions from `model_config.json`, the species locale used to localize labels, the export timestamp (UTC), and a verbatim snapshot of every SharedPreferences setting at the moment of export. This makes exports self-describing — an analyst opening a survey ZIP months later (or receiving one from another recordist) can answer exactly which app version, which model, and which user settings produced the detections without having to ask. Critical for scientific reproducibility, especially when sharing survey data between researchers.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Survey selection-table exports for sessions started before 0.6.7 now report correct in-clip detection times.** Those sessions were saved without a `clipContextSeconds` value (the field didn't exist yet), so the exporter assumed 0 seconds of pre-roll and printed `Begin Time = 0.000 / End Time = 3.000` for every clip — placing the Raven selection box at the very start of each clip even when the actual call sat 1–2 seconds in. The exporter now falls back to the device's current Survey “Clip Context” setting whenever a session has clip files but no recorded context value, so legacy bundles produce the same selections as freshly recorded ones.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **Session exports now use localized common names everywhere they're rendered as text.** Clip filenames inside the ZIP bundle (e.g. `…_clip_001_Amsel.flac` for a German user instead of `…_clip_001_Eurasian_Blackbird.flac`), the `Common Name` column in Raven selection tables, and the `Common Name` column in CSV exports all use the user's species locale. Scientific Name columns are always emitted regardless of the "Show scientific names" UI toggle so exports remain scientifically authoritative.
- **Survey selection tables now report in-clip detection times.** Previously, `Begin Time (s)` / `End Time (s)` were session-relative offsets even for rows referencing per-detection clip files — which made Raven Pro draw the selection box at the wrong place inside the clip (or off the end entirely). Now those columns describe the detection's offset *within the clip file* (i.e. they bracket the model's window after the pre-roll context). A new `Survey Time (s)` column carries the original session-relative offset so analysts can still cross-reference detections against the survey timeline. The CSV export gains the same `Survey Time (s)` column when clip files are present. For sessions exporting a single continuous recording, behavior is unchanged.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Session library cards now show on-disk audio size** as a fourth stat chip. The value is the total of the continuous recording (live, point count, file analysis) plus all per-detection clips (survey), so you can spot heavy sessions at a glance before exporting or deleting. Sessions with no audio on disk silently omit the chip.

### Fixed

- **Species names are now localized and respect the "Show scientific names" setting in every place a detection is rendered.** The fullscreen survey-map clip-player sheet showed the English common name and always the sci name; the survey live-screen summary species list, the session library's grouped-by-species view subtitles, and the add/replace-species overlay banner + result tiles had the same gaps. All of them now go through the taxonomy lookup with the active species locale and hide the sci name when the setting is off.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Detections recorded before the audio recorder fully spun up no longer have broken "00:-1" timestamps.** Session-relative offsets are now clamped to `[00:00, audio duration]` both at storage time (in `LiveSession.addDetection(s)`) and at render/seek time, so these detections display sensibly and play back from a valid position instead of silently failing.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Onboarding flow rewritten end-to-end.** Replaced the `introduction_screen` package + separate Terms-Of-Use gate (which prompted for ToU twice) with a single custom PageView wizard. Pages now use a compact icon badge instead of an oversized centered icon, giving body text the screen real estate it deserves. The Permissions page is now interactive — tapping Grant on Microphone or Location triggers the actual OS prompt (via `record` and `geolocator`) and shows a green check on success. Terms & Privacy is the final page with an inline "I agree" checkbox; Get Started is disabled until checked, and on finish both `onboardingComplete` and `termsAccepted` are persisted in one shot. Skip jumps directly to the Terms page rather than bypassing acceptance.

### Removed

- `introduction_screen` dependency (no longer needed) and the standalone `TermsGateScreen` (its role is folded into the onboarding flow).

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Explore screen header decluttered** — the search bar and group-filter chip row are now hidden by default. Tap the AppBar lens icon to slide in the search field, or the filter icon to reveal the chip row. A small dot on the filter icon indicates when a non-default group filter is active. Toggling one collapses the other so only one control is visible at a time.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Explore screen species search** — search field at the top of the Explore screen runs over the full audio-model species list, not only the geo-filtered subset. Matches are split into "At your location" and "Other species" sections so distant species (e.g. Blue Jay or Gray Wolf in Europe) can still be opened to view their info card.
- **Explore taxonomic group filter** — horizontal chip row to restrict the list to All / Birds / Mammals / Amphibians / Insects. Filter applies to both the geo-likely list and the search results.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Session review species search** — search now matches localized common names (German, French, Spanish, Czech, Italian, Portuguese), not only English. Results are ranked by text relevance: full-string prefix > word prefix > substring, with observation count as a tie-breaker. Geo-likely species are softly boosted but never demoted from a strong text match.
- **Multi-token search** — typing multiple words (e.g. "barn owl") now correctly matches species containing all tokens in any order.

### Changed

- **Add/Replace species overlay redesign** — when invoked from "Replace this detection" on a specific cluster, the picker now shows a banner with the detection being replaced (thumbnail, common name, scientific name) and skips the redundant mode selector and dropdown — the user only chooses the new species.
- **Add species (FAB)** — defaults to "Insert at playback position" (the more useful mode) and drops the unused "Replace" segment from this entry path.
- **Result tiles** include a 48×48 species thumbnail.
- **Empty / no-result states** — clear hint when the search field is empty (with "Unknown / Other" surfaced as a quick action) and a friendly "no results" message when nothing matches.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Spectrogram render quality is now user-configurable (Low / Medium / High) under Settings → Spectrogram, with High as the default for sharp live spectrograms and Low as a fallback for older phones
- Survey foreground notification now uses a monochrome blue jay silhouette as the status-bar small icon instead of a generic circle
- Species info overlay opens to the user's locale Wikipedia page when bundled (interface locales: en, de, fr, es, cs, pt, it), falling back to English

### Changed
- Default visible spectrogram duration raised from 15 s to 20 s for a wider live view
- Live and Point Count spectrograms render with the configured filter quality (was hardcoded low) for noticeably crisper detail when upscaled
- Session review spectrogram now uses FFT 2048 + high filter quality for sharper detection-clip previews
- Live mode keeps the recording running across pause so audio and detection timestamps remain continuous; detections are now timestamped at the start of the analyzed window for accurate review playback
- Recording capture uses a unified clip-context setting and now captures true pre+post audio around each detection
- Survey detection markers only show the play badge when the audio clip actually exists on disk; markers gain a stronger audio affordance (accent ring, larger badge, grey border for silent markers)
- Tapping the active play button in session review now pauses playback (works for both Live and Survey clips)
- Species info overlay now uses fully bundled taxonomy data — eBird link is shown only when an `ebird_code` exists (insects and other non-birds correctly hide it), iNaturalist only when an `inat_id` exists, and Wikipedia only when a bundled URL exists for the active locale
- eBird link chip uses the Cornell Lab sapsucker silhouette as its icon
- German UI uses "Detektion" / "Detektionen" instead of "Erkennung" / "Erkennungen" throughout for clearer detection terminology

### Fixed
- Survey detection clip player honors the pause toggle (previously kept playing when tapping the active play button)

### Privacy / Hardening
- Verified the app makes no network calls beyond OSM map tiles and OSM Nominatim reverse geocoding (both gated by a single one-time consent); no taxonomy API, no analytics, no telemetry
- Removed the unused `cached_network_image` dependency and dead taxonomy-API URL helpers (`thumbUrl` / `mediumUrl` getters and the static API base URL) so future code cannot accidentally reintroduce taxonomy-API fetches

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Survey map markers now show a small play badge on detections whose audio clip was retained, making it visually obvious which icons can be played back
- Tapping a marker with audio opens a modal player overlay with a spectrogram preview, scrubber, and play/pause controls (replaces the old silent in-place playback)

### Changed
- Smart sampling: same-spot distance threshold reduced from 500 m to 250 m and a per-species minimum of 3 retained clips is always honored — the first three high-confidence detections of a species always survive, even when they share a spot
- Survey foreground notification now refreshes about once per second so the lock-screen timer matches actual recording time (session disk persistence stays on its 30 s cadence)
- Survey "elapsed" / total recorded time now excludes pause/resume gaps. `LiveSession` persists `recordedDurationSeconds`; resumed sessions accumulate active time across segments instead of measuring wall-clock from the original start
- Detection map widget prefers audio-bearing detections when collapsing duplicates at the same location so the play badge is accurate
- "Smart" sampling label kept untranslated across all locales (was "Intelligent" / "Inteligente" / etc.) to prevent layout overflow on narrow devices

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Onboarding pages use a more compact layout (smaller icons, smaller title, tighter padding) so the Terms & Privacy page — including the Privacy Policy link — fits on one screen on compact devices

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Onboarding dots indicator no longer overflows on narrow displays now that the carousel has 6 pages (smaller dot size, tighter spacing, narrower active dot)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Onboarding screens now use smaller icons and reduced top padding to prevent overflow on compact displays
- Terms of Use and Privacy Policy text (onboarding gate and Terms step) updated to reflect that both map tiles and reverse geocoding share a single one-time consent
- User-facing copy made taxonomically agnostic across all 7 locales — replaced "bird species", "bird identification", "bird detection", and "bird calls" with "species", "species identification", "detection", and "animal calls" respectively (the app supports more than birds)
- Terms gate now also explicitly forbids use for poaching, illegal wildlife trade, and military purposes, matching the published Terms of Use

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Point Count setup now collects a custom name and observer name (parity with Survey); observer is remembered across sessions
- Onboarding gained a dedicated Terms & Privacy step with deep links to the full Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
- Session auto-stop reasons (manual, duration, battery, storage) and ETA hints during long-running sessions
- Loading skeleton for species info while taxonomy data resolves
- Accessibility labels for live capture controls and confidence metrics; haptic feedback on selection changes
- Session review now tracks playback position and highlights the active detection window
- New shared `WizardScaffold` for multi-step setup wizards (Live, Point Count, Survey, File Analysis)
- Shared loading, error, empty-state, and confirmation-dialog widgets across the app
- `ScoreColors` theme extension providing a consistent five-step confidence color scale
- Settings help tooltips and expanded UI tooltips throughout the app
- JSON export now includes full session metadata (custom name, session number, observer, transect ID, distance, stop reason)
- Detection windows now record end timestamps (live and survey) for accurate review and export

### Changed
- Reverse geocoding is now gated by the same one-time consent prompt as map tiles (no requests to OpenStreetMap until the user approves)
- Detection sampling for surveys reworked with clearer logic, expanded test coverage, and improved documentation
- Map handling and location services hardened (permission flow, lifecycle, and error states)
- Survey finalization flow hardened against edge cases during cleanup
- Documentation updated to use Material Design icon names consistently

### Fixed
- Runtime cleanup edge cases on session stop and screen disposal
- Integration test warnings cleaned up

## [0.2.9] â€” 2025-07-27

### Added
- Share/export button now available for survey sessions (CSV, JSON, GPX, Raven â€” audio optional)

### Fixed

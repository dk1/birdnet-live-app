# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.11] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Score-pooling window count is now configurable.** A new slider under *Settings → Inference → Score pooling* (1–10, default 5) controls how many recent inference windows the temporal pooling buffer averages over before declaring a detection. Lower values react faster to fleeting calls; higher values smooth out spurious noise spikes at the cost of a slightly delayed first-detection. The setting is plumbed all the way through to the inference isolate (`InferenceIsolate.setMaxPoolWindows`) and applied at the start of every Live, Point Count, and Survey session — including resumed Surveys.
- **"You have detected this species" stats in the species info overlay.** Tapping a species card in Explore now shows, alongside the photo and 48-week probability chart, a personal summary aggregated from your saved sessions: how many times you've logged the species, across how many sessions, and the date of your most recent detection. The summary is hidden for species you've never recorded so the overlay stays uncluttered for unfamiliar birds.
- **Checkmark badge on previously detected species.** Species you've detected at least once in any saved session now show a small primary-coloured check badge in the corner of the photo — both on Explore cards and on the larger image inside the species info overlay. Makes it easy to skim Explore and spot which birds are new to your personal life list versus already logged.
- **A–Z (and Z–A) sort in Session Library by-species view.** The by-species grouping now respects the *Sort* selector: choosing *Name (A–Z)* or *Name (Z–A)* alphabetises species rows by their localised display name (with scientific-name tiebreak); the date sort modes preserve the existing "most-detected first" ordering. The species search field also now filters the by-species view, with an empty-state message when no species match the query.
- **Help icons on Session Library filter sections.** Each labelled section (*Sort*, *View*, *Filter*) in the filter sheet now has a small help icon explaining what that section does.

### Changed

- **Application ID changed to `de.tu_chemnitz.mi.kahst.birdnet_live`.** The Android `applicationId` was bumped from the placeholder `com.birdnet.birdnet_live` to a stable, namespaced identifier suitable for Play Store publication. The Kotlin `namespace` is unchanged so existing builds keep compiling.
- **Sort / view / filter selectors in the Session Library are now combinable.** Picking a sort order no longer resets the view mode or active filters, and vice versa — the three controls are independent.
- **Session Library view-mode chip now highlights immediately.** Tapping *Compact*, *Detailed*, or *By species* updates the chip selection synchronously in the bottom sheet instead of waiting for the SharedPreferences write to complete, so the highlight follows the tap with no perceived lag.

### Fixed

- **Segment label overflow in Session Library filter sheet.** Long localised labels (e.g. *By species* in some locales) no longer push the segmented control out of its container.
- **Recording format / size selector hidden when audio recording is off.** When *Save full recording* is disabled in settings, the format and size sliders are now hidden instead of greyed-out, removing dead UI from the screen.
- **Session size estimation in the home screen.** The "estimated size" label on the live mode card now reflects the active recording format and bitrate.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **Explore species cards no longer crop the edges of the photo.** The card's row was stretching every tile to a uniform height, which made the thumbnail box slightly taller than its native 3:2 ratio. With `BoxFit.cover` the image was being scaled up to fill that extra height and a slice was getting cut off the sides. The thumbnail is now sized to its natural 3:2 ratio (96×64) and centered vertically in the row, so the whole bird is visible while the card's rounded corners on the left still hug the photo.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Inference Parameters step in the Point Count setup wizard.** Point Count now has a fourth setup step — between *Duration & Context* and *Field Tips* — that lets you tweak window duration (3 / 5 / 10 s), inference rate (0.25–4 Hz), confidence threshold (1–99 %) and species filter mode just for that one count, without touching your global defaults. Values are seeded from your global settings so the default behaviour is unchanged; tweaking them only affects the count you're about to start. Mirrors the same parameters page that File Analysis already exposes, but with an *inference rate* slider instead of *overlap* (since live inference is rate-driven, not overlap-driven).
- **Per-mode icon colours throughout the app.** Each mode now has its own accent colour applied to its icon — red for Live (recording), blue for Point Count (a fixed pin), green for Survey (a route), and amber for File Analysis (an archived file). The colour shows up everywhere the mode icon appears: the home menu cards, the Help screen sections, and Session Library cards / list rows / species-grouped sub-rows. Tile and card backgrounds are deliberately untouched — only the glyph itself is tinted, so the surrounding layout stays calm and you can recognise a mode at a glance without the screen feeling busier. Centralised in `shared/utils/session_type_visuals.dart` so the home, help, and history surfaces can never drift apart again.

### Changed

- **Session Library: three-dot menu replaced with a single, well-organised filter sheet.** The cluttered toolbar dropdown is gone — there's now a single :material-filter-list-outlined: button that opens a clean modal bottom sheet with three labelled sections (*Sort*, *View*, *Filter*) using chip selectors. Same options as before, but the relationship between sort order, view mode, and filter is finally visible at a glance, and the sheet opens in the natural place for a touch (bottom of the screen) instead of cascading off the right edge.
- **Session Library view mode (Compact / Detailed / By species) now persists across app restarts.** Picking *By species* once will keep the library in that view the next time you open it, instead of snapping back to *Compact* on every cold start.
- **Bundled species photos now show the full, un-distorted bird.** Auditing the BirdNET taxonomy API turned up that *both* the `medium` (480×320) and `thumb` (150×100) responses are 3:2 — not 4:3 as we'd assumed. Our build pipeline was resizing every photo to 320×240 (4:3), which silently squashed every bird vertically. The bundle is now built at 360×240 (true 3:2) at higher WebP quality (`82` instead of `75`, with `method=6` for best compression effort), and `process_image()` letterboxes any non-3:2 source instead of stretching it. Every in-app species frame (Explore card, info overlay, Live detection list, Session Review thumbnail, Session Library species rows) was switched to a matching 3:2 box so what you see in the app is now exactly the photo the BirdNET team curated. The species-image asset bundle grows from ~44 MB to ~60 MB; the release APK gains a few MB but the photos finally look right.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **About screen: audio model and geo-model now share a single card.** Each model still gets its own labelled section (display name only), with the species count printed once at the bottom — it's the same 5,250-species intersection for both. The narrative description under the geo-model is gone; the section header already conveys what it is.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Tap a species thumbnail in Session Review to open its info overlay.** The 48 dp thumbnail next to each species row in Session Review is now its own tap target — long-pressing the row still works, but the photo itself is the more discoverable shortcut to the full species sheet (description, photo credit, links).

### Fixed

- **Species photos no longer cropped vertically in the info overlay.** The overlay was rendering bundled photos in a 3:2 frame with `BoxFit.cover`, which sliced off the top and bottom of every 320×240 thumbnail. The frame is now 4:3 and uses `BoxFit.contain`, so the full photo — the same crop the BirdNET team curated — is always visible.
- **Inline species thumbnails now match the bundled photo aspect ratio.** Session Review (48×36) and the live detection list (60×45) used 3:2 boxes that quietly cropped a slice off every photo. Both are now 4:3, matching the 320×240 source files, so each photo is shown in full without distortion. The Explore species cards switched to the same 4:3 frame for consistency.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **Survey track map filter now localizes species names.** The species picker in the fullscreen map's filter sheet was showing the raw English common name baked into each detection record and always italicized the scientific name underneath, ignoring both the *Species names* language setting and the *Show scientific names* toggle. Names now go through the taxonomy lookup like everywhere else in the app, so they appear in your chosen species locale, and scientific names only show when you've turned them on in Settings.
- **High-confidence filter is now an actual slider.** The previous "High confidence (≥80 %)" preset did nothing for sessions whose detection threshold was already at or above 80 %. The filter sheet now has a *Minimum confidence* slider (50 % – 99 %) that you can drag to whatever floor makes sense for the session, with a live percentage readout.

### Changed

- **Cleaner species picker in the map filter sheet.** The long radio-list of species has been replaced with a search field plus a tap-to-select list using check-circle icons. Typing into the search field filters the list against both the localized common name and the scientific name, and an *All species* row at the top makes clearing the species filter a single tap.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Filter button on the fullscreen survey track map.** The map's app bar now has a :material-filter-list-outlined: button that opens a filter sheet for restricting which detection markers are drawn. Filter modes are *All detections*, *With audio clip* (only markers whose clip is still on disk), *High confidence* (≥80 %), and *Manual additions* (only the ones you added in Session Review). A *Limit to species* picker lets you collapse the map to a single species — useful for asking "where exactly along the route did I hear the wood thrush?". The two filters combine, an active filter shows a dot on the icon and a match-count subtitle in the app bar, and an *Empty filter* card appears at the bottom of the map when nothing matches.
- **Funding card on the About screen.** Acknowledges support for BirdNET Live development by the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt through the project RangerSound (project 39263/01).

### Changed

- **Onboarding screens use vertical space more carefully.** The icon-only top half is gone — every page now starts its body copy near the top of the safe area instead of at the vertical centre, so the Terms-Of-Use page no longer overflows on smaller phones. Hero icons are smaller (44 dp instead of 56 dp), spacings are tighter, and the bottom controls bar is more compact.
- **The "Credits" card on the About screen is now titled "Developed by"** in every locale, since the card just names the BirdNET development team and never actually thanked anyone.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **Survey notification is now fully translated.** The recent-detections list, stats footer (elapsed time / detections / species / distance), and notification title now all honor the user's selected app locale instead of mixing English fragments. Species names are also resolved lazily on each notification refresh, so they start translating as soon as the taxonomy service finishes loading even if it loads after survey start.
- **Recent-detections list deduplicates by species.** A chatty bird no longer fills all three slots — the list now shows the three most-recent *unique* species instead.
- **Recent detections appear above the stats footer**, separated by a blank line, so the most actionable information (what was just heard) sits at the top of the expanded notification.

### Added

- `surveyNotificationStats` ARB key with `{elapsed}` / `{detections}` / `{species}` / `{distanceKm}` placeholders so each locale can adjust unit ordering, abbreviations, and pluralization for the stats footer.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **The persistent survey notification now lists the three most recent detections**, each on its own line with the localized common name, confidence percentage, and a short relative timestamp (`just now`, `42s ago`, `5m ago`, `2h ago`). On Android the lines are visible as soon as the notification is expanded thanks to the underlying BigTextStyle, so you can glance at the lock screen mid-survey and see what's been heard most recently without unlocking the phone. Species names honor the user's species locale and the *Show scientific names* toggle, identical to the in-app cards.

### Added

- New ARB keys `surveySecondsAgo` and `surveyHoursAgo` (paired with the existing `surveyJustNow` / `surveyMinutesAgo`) so the relative timestamps in the notification render naturally in every supported language (en/de/cs/es/fr/it/pt).

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **Watchlist editor is now a real species picker.** Replaced the cramped paste-the-scientific-names dialog with a full-screen editor: a search field on top scans the entire taxonomy (matches scientific name, English common name, and every localized common name) and shows tappable checkbox results, while an *Import from file* button reads any `.txt`/`.csv` plain-text list of scientific names from device storage. The selected-species pane stays visible when you clear the search so it's obvious what's already in the list, and selections survive locale switches because friendly labels are cached at pick time.
- **Survey alert notifications now use a monochrome blue-jay icon** instead of a white square. Switched both `SpeciesAlertNotifier.init` and `requestPermission` to the existing `ic_notification` drawable that the foreground-service notification already uses, so the heads-up alert visually matches the persistent recording notification.
- **Cleaner alert text.** Notifications no longer repeat the species name twice (title and body both said it). The body is now just the reason — *"First detection of this survey"*, *"On your watchlist"*, *"Detected at this location with under 4% likelihood"*, etc. — keeping the species name in the bold notification title where Android renders it largest.
- **Localized notifications work end-to-end.** When the app delivers a species alert it now uses the user's selected species locale (and respects the *Show scientific names* toggle), so a German user sees *Kohlmeise* in the notification instead of *Great Tit*. The localizer plumbs through `SurveyAlertCoordinator` so it stays correct across coalesced summary alerts too.
- **German wording fix.** *Erkennung* in the alert bodies is now *Detektion*, matching the term used everywhere else in the German UI.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **Species-alerts wizard step is now a real, finished UX.** The setup screen for the new push alerts has been rebuilt: a *Minimum confidence* slider sits below the mode picker and is automatically floored to your session confidence threshold (alerts can never be more sensitive than the detections themselves). The advanced *Frequency control* section now uses one-tap chip selectors for startup grace (Off / 30 s / 1 m / 2 m / 5 m), minimum interval (Off / 5 / 15 / 30 / 60 s) and per-minute cap (1 / 3 / 5 / 10 / Unlimited) instead of free-form integer text fields. The rare-species slider gained a live readout — *"Alerts on species with under 5 % likelihood at this location."* — so you understand what the slider position will actually do before you start the survey. A help button in the step header opens an in-context bottom sheet explaining the alert modes and the throttling rules.
- **Watchlist creation and management directly in the wizard.** Previously the Watchlist alert mode was a dead end if you hadn't already created a list — and there was no way *anywhere* in the app to create one. The wizard now lists all saved watchlists as selectable tiles with a species count, lets you delete lists with a confirmation dialog, and exposes a *New watchlist* button that opens an inline editor for naming a list and pasting a block of scientific names (one per line) straight from your clipboard. Picking Watchlist mode without selecting a list now blocks the Next button with a clear inline error.

### Added

- **Notification-permission prompt on mode change.** Picking any non-Off alert mode in the wizard now triggers the Android notification-permission request the first time it's needed, so you don't have to remember to grant it from system settings before alerts can fire.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Push-style species alerts during surveys.** A new step in the survey setup wizard lets you choose when to receive a heads-up notification mid-survey: *Off* (default), *First in session* (one alert the first time each species is heard), *First ever* (alert only when the app encounters a species for the very first time across all your sessions — a "lifer" alert), *Rare for this location* (alert when the geo-model probability for the current location is below a configurable threshold, so a Black-throated Sparrow showing up in Bavaria gets your attention), or *Watchlist* (alert only on species you've added to a saved custom list). Alerts respect a configurable confidence floor and fire on a separate Android notification channel so you can mute them independently of the silent ongoing survey-recording notification.
- **Smart frequency control for alerts.** Real surveys often see a flurry of new species in the first few minutes — without throttling, the device would buzz constantly. The pipeline now applies three layered limits: a startup grace window (default 60 s) that suppresses *first-in-session* alerts at the start of a survey while still letting rare/watchlist alerts fire immediately, a hard minimum interval between any two alerts (default 15 s), and a sliding per-minute cap (default 3) with optional coalescing — over-cap alerts queue into a single summary notification ("3 more new species: ...") instead of being dropped. All limits are user-configurable from an *Advanced* section in the wizard.
- **Lifetime species history**, persisted in app preferences, powers the *First ever* mode. On first launch after upgrading, the app backfills the history from your existing session records so the very first survey under 0.7.0 doesn't fire a "lifer" for every common species you've already recorded.

## [0.6.9] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Every session export now ships with full provenance metadata.** ZIP bundles always include a `<prefix>.metadata.json` side-file alongside the audio and selection table, and JSON exports gain a top-level `meta` block. The metadata captures the app version and build number, the audio and geo model names/versions from `model_config.json`, the species locale used to localize labels, the export timestamp (UTC), and a verbatim snapshot of every SharedPreferences setting at the moment of export. This makes exports self-describing — an analyst opening a survey ZIP months later (or receiving one from another recordist) can answer exactly which app version, which model, and which user settings produced the detections without having to ask. Critical for scientific reproducibility, especially when sharing survey data between researchers.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Survey selection-table exports for sessions started before 0.6.7 now report correct in-clip detection times.** Those sessions were saved without a `clipContextSeconds` value (the field didn't exist yet), so the exporter assumed 0 seconds of pre-roll and printed `Begin Time = 0.000 / End Time = 3.000` for every clip — placing the Raven selection box at the very start of each clip even when the actual call sat 1–2 seconds in. The exporter now falls back to the device's current Survey “Clip Context” setting whenever a session has clip files but no recorded context value, so legacy bundles produce the same selections as freshly recorded ones.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **Session exports now use localized common names everywhere they're rendered as text.** Clip filenames inside the ZIP bundle (e.g. `…_clip_001_Amsel.flac` for a German user instead of `…_clip_001_Eurasian_Blackbird.flac`), the `Common Name` column in Raven selection tables, and the `Common Name` column in CSV exports all use the user's species locale. Scientific Name columns are always emitted regardless of the "Show scientific names" UI toggle so exports remain scientifically authoritative.
- **Survey selection tables now report in-clip detection times.** Previously, `Begin Time (s)` / `End Time (s)` were session-relative offsets even for rows referencing per-detection clip files — which made Raven Pro draw the selection box at the wrong place inside the clip (or off the end entirely). Now those columns describe the detection's offset *within the clip file* (i.e. they bracket the model's window after the pre-roll context). A new `Survey Time (s)` column carries the original session-relative offset so analysts can still cross-reference detections against the survey timeline. The CSV export gains the same `Survey Time (s)` column when clip files are present. For sessions exporting a single continuous recording, behavior is unchanged.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Session library cards now show on-disk audio size** as a fourth stat chip. The value is the total of the continuous recording (live, point count, file analysis) plus all per-detection clips (survey), so you can spot heavy sessions at a glance before exporting or deleting. Sessions with no audio on disk silently omit the chip.

### Fixed

- **Species names are now localized and respect the "Show scientific names" setting in every place a detection is rendered.** The fullscreen survey-map clip-player sheet showed the English common name and always the sci name; the survey live-screen summary species list, the session library's grouped-by-species view subtitles, and the add/replace-species overlay banner + result tiles had the same gaps. All of them now go through the taxonomy lookup with the active species locale and hide the sci name when the setting is off.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Detections recorded before the audio recorder fully spun up no longer have broken "00:-1" timestamps.** Session-relative offsets are now clamped to `[00:00, audio duration]` both at storage time (in `LiveSession.addDetection(s)`) and at render/seek time, so these detections display sensibly and play back from a valid position instead of silently failing.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Onboarding flow rewritten end-to-end.** Replaced the `introduction_screen` package + separate Terms-Of-Use gate (which prompted for ToU twice) with a single custom PageView wizard. Pages now use a compact icon badge instead of an oversized centered icon, giving body text the screen real estate it deserves. The Permissions page is now interactive — tapping Grant on Microphone or Location triggers the actual OS prompt (via `record` and `geolocator`) and shows a green check on success. Terms & Privacy is the final page with an inline "I agree" checkbox; Get Started is disabled until checked, and on finish both `onboardingComplete` and `termsAccepted` are persisted in one shot. Skip jumps directly to the Terms page rather than bypassing acceptance.

### Removed

- `introduction_screen` dependency (no longer needed) and the standalone `TermsGateScreen` (its role is folded into the onboarding flow).

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Explore screen header decluttered** — the search bar and group-filter chip row are now hidden by default. Tap the AppBar lens icon to slide in the search field, or the filter icon to reveal the chip row. A small dot on the filter icon indicates when a non-default group filter is active. Toggling one collapses the other so only one control is visible at a time.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Explore screen species search** — search field at the top of the Explore screen runs over the full audio-model species list, not only the geo-filtered subset. Matches are split into "At your location" and "Other species" sections so distant species (e.g. Blue Jay or Gray Wolf in Europe) can still be opened to view their info card.
- **Explore taxonomic group filter** — horizontal chip row to restrict the list to All / Birds / Mammals / Amphibians / Insects. Filter applies to both the geo-likely list and the search results.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Session review species search** — search now matches localized common names (German, French, Spanish, Czech, Italian, Portuguese), not only English. Results are ranked by text relevance: full-string prefix > word prefix > substring, with observation count as a tie-breaker. Geo-likely species are softly boosted but never demoted from a strong text match.
- **Multi-token search** — typing multiple words (e.g. "barn owl") now correctly matches species containing all tokens in any order.

### Changed

- **Add/Replace species overlay redesign** — when invoked from "Replace this detection" on a specific cluster, the picker now shows a banner with the detection being replaced (thumbnail, common name, scientific name) and skips the redundant mode selector and dropdown — the user only chooses the new species.
- **Add species (FAB)** — defaults to "Insert at playback position" (the more useful mode) and drops the unused "Replace" segment from this entry path.
- **Result tiles** include a 48×48 species thumbnail.
- **Empty / no-result states** — clear hint when the search field is empty (with "Unknown / Other" surfaced as a quick action) and a friendly "no results" message when nothing matches.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Spectrogram render quality is now user-configurable (Low / Medium / High) under Settings → Spectrogram, with High as the default for sharp live spectrograms and Low as a fallback for older phones
- Survey foreground notification now uses a monochrome blue jay silhouette as the status-bar small icon instead of a generic circle
- Species info overlay opens to the user's locale Wikipedia page when bundled (interface locales: en, de, fr, es, cs, pt, it), falling back to English

### Changed
- Default visible spectrogram duration raised from 15 s to 20 s for a wider live view
- Live and Point Count spectrograms render with the configured filter quality (was hardcoded low) for noticeably crisper detail when upscaled
- Session review spectrogram now uses FFT 2048 + high filter quality for sharper detection-clip previews
- Live mode keeps the recording running across pause so audio and detection timestamps remain continuous; detections are now timestamped at the start of the analyzed window for accurate review playback
- Recording capture uses a unified clip-context setting and now captures true pre+post audio around each detection
- Survey detection markers only show the play badge when the audio clip actually exists on disk; markers gain a stronger audio affordance (accent ring, larger badge, grey border for silent markers)
- Tapping the active play button in session review now pauses playback (works for both Live and Survey clips)
- Species info overlay now uses fully bundled taxonomy data — eBird link is shown only when an `ebird_code` exists (insects and other non-birds correctly hide it), iNaturalist only when an `inat_id` exists, and Wikipedia only when a bundled URL exists for the active locale
- eBird link chip uses the Cornell Lab sapsucker silhouette as its icon
- German UI uses "Detektion" / "Detektionen" instead of "Erkennung" / "Erkennungen" throughout for clearer detection terminology

### Fixed
- Survey detection clip player honors the pause toggle (previously kept playing when tapping the active play button)

### Privacy / Hardening
- Verified the app makes no network calls beyond OSM map tiles and OSM Nominatim reverse geocoding (both gated by a single one-time consent); no taxonomy API, no analytics, no telemetry
- Removed the unused `cached_network_image` dependency and dead taxonomy-API URL helpers (`thumbUrl` / `mediumUrl` getters and the static API base URL) so future code cannot accidentally reintroduce taxonomy-API fetches

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Survey map markers now show a small play badge on detections whose audio clip was retained, making it visually obvious which icons can be played back
- Tapping a marker with audio opens a modal player overlay with a spectrogram preview, scrubber, and play/pause controls (replaces the old silent in-place playback)

### Changed
- Smart sampling: same-spot distance threshold reduced from 500 m to 250 m and a per-species minimum of 3 retained clips is always honored — the first three high-confidence detections of a species always survive, even when they share a spot
- Survey foreground notification now refreshes about once per second so the lock-screen timer matches actual recording time (session disk persistence stays on its 30 s cadence)
- Survey "elapsed" / total recorded time now excludes pause/resume gaps. `LiveSession` persists `recordedDurationSeconds`; resumed sessions accumulate active time across segments instead of measuring wall-clock from the original start
- Detection map widget prefers audio-bearing detections when collapsing duplicates at the same location so the play badge is accurate
- "Smart" sampling label kept untranslated across all locales (was "Intelligent" / "Inteligente" / etc.) to prevent layout overflow on narrow devices

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Onboarding pages use a more compact layout (smaller icons, smaller title, tighter padding) so the Terms & Privacy page — including the Privacy Policy link — fits on one screen on compact devices

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Onboarding dots indicator no longer overflows on narrow displays now that the carousel has 6 pages (smaller dot size, tighter spacing, narrower active dot)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Onboarding screens now use smaller icons and reduced top padding to prevent overflow on compact displays
- Terms of Use and Privacy Policy text (onboarding gate and Terms step) updated to reflect that both map tiles and reverse geocoding share a single one-time consent
- User-facing copy made taxonomically agnostic across all 7 locales — replaced "bird species", "bird identification", "bird detection", and "bird calls" with "species", "species identification", "detection", and "animal calls" respectively (the app supports more than birds)
- Terms gate now also explicitly forbids use for poaching, illegal wildlife trade, and military purposes, matching the published Terms of Use

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Point Count setup now collects a custom name and observer name (parity with Survey); observer is remembered across sessions
- Onboarding gained a dedicated Terms & Privacy step with deep links to the full Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
- Session auto-stop reasons (manual, duration, battery, storage) and ETA hints during long-running sessions
- Loading skeleton for species info while taxonomy data resolves
- Accessibility labels for live capture controls and confidence metrics; haptic feedback on selection changes
- Session review now tracks playback position and highlights the active detection window
- New shared `WizardScaffold` for multi-step setup wizards (Live, Point Count, Survey, File Analysis)
- Shared loading, error, empty-state, and confirmation-dialog widgets across the app
- `ScoreColors` theme extension providing a consistent five-step confidence color scale
- Settings help tooltips and expanded UI tooltips throughout the app
- JSON export now includes full session metadata (custom name, session number, observer, transect ID, distance, stop reason)
- Detection windows now record end timestamps (live and survey) for accurate review and export

### Changed
- Reverse geocoding is now gated by the same one-time consent prompt as map tiles (no requests to OpenStreetMap until the user approves)
- Detection sampling for surveys reworked with clearer logic, expanded test coverage, and improved documentation
- Map handling and location services hardened (permission flow, lifecycle, and error states)
- Survey finalization flow hardened against edge cases during cleanup
- Documentation updated to use Material Design icon names consistently

### Fixed
- Runtime cleanup edge cases on session stop and screen disposal
- Integration test warnings cleaned up

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Direct User Guide access from the Help screen
- A File Analysis app bar shortcut to the relevant settings panel
- Expanded the User Guide with workflow pages for Live, Explore, Session Library, Session Review, Point Count, Survey, File Analysis, icons and controls, and settings
- Added screen-level help overlays across operational workflows, including a common help-sheet layout and icon explanations that match the current UI

### Changed
- Localized remaining user-facing strings in file analysis, explore, settings, and survey notifications across all supported locales
- Updated Help guidance to point users to the User Guide from both Help and About

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Tracked species bundle tooling under `tools/`, including a public taxonomy JSON download helper
- Developer documentation for reproducing bundled species images and metadata through mkdocs

### Changed
- Bundled species images now rebuild at 480x320 WebP with slightly lower quality for better full-size detail rendering

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- "(Developer preview)" badge natively shown next to version info on Home Screen and About Screen
- Expanded user guide to cover all settings with the *intuition/rationale* behind changing them

## [0.3.2] â€” 2025-07-28

### Added
- Confidence threshold slider in survey setup (Parameters step)
- Clip context controls (pre/post buffer seconds) in survey setup when recording mode is detections
- Clip context controls in global settings when recording mode is detections
- Tap species marker on fullscreen survey map to play detection clip with highlight

### Changed
- File analysis step indicator now uses simple progress bars (matching point count and survey setup)
- Smart detection sampling reworked: uses distance (>500 m) and time (>2 min) thresholds instead of fixed spatial bins; keeps only the highest-scoring detection per species at each spot

## [0.3.1] â€” 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Privacy policy updated to reflect offline species data bundle and current data handling
- Terms of use now hosted on the documentation site (was GitHub markdown)

### Added
- Terms of Use page in mkdocs documentation

## [0.3.0] â€” 2025-07-28

### Added
- `Begin File` column in Raven selection tables for multi-file compatibility
- `File` column in CSV exports referencing the audio source
- Latitude / Longitude columns in Raven and CSV exports when detections have coordinates
- GPX file auto-included in survey ZIP bundles
- Species common name in detection clip filenames (e.g. `_clip_001_Eurasian_Blackbird.flac`)
- Custom session name included in export filenames
- JSON export now includes session type, location, and per-detection coordinates
- Export prefix `BirdNET_Live_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` for all exported files (display names unchanged)

### Fixed
- Detection timestamps in exports are always session-relative (no more 0-based times for clips)
- Survey share now correctly produces ZIP bundles with individual detection clips
- `manualGlobal` detection end time in CSV uses session duration (consistent with Raven builder)
- Removed unused local variable in `live_controller.dart`

### Changed
- Session display names no longer use `BirdNET_Live` prefix (cleaner in-app display)

## [0.2.10] â€” 2025-07-27

### Added
- Recording mode setting (Full / Detections only / Off) restored to settings screen as segmented button
- Detection clip playback in session review: when only detection clips were recorded (no full recording), play buttons play individual clips

### Fixed
- Survey sessions with "detections only" recording mode now surface audio clips correctly in session review
- Play buttons hidden in session review when no audio exists (recording mode was off)

## [0.2.9] â€” 2025-07-27

### Added
- Share/export button now available for survey sessions (CSV, JSON, GPX, Raven â€” audio optional)

### Fixed
- Survey sessions now always record full audio (like live sessions) so playback and trim work in review
- Recording mode default changed from "off" to "full" for live sessions (live controller already recorded full regardless)

### Changed
- Recording mode setting removed from general settings screen (only exposed in survey setup where it applies)
- Observer name and track distance shown in a single row in session review header
- Survey map in session review reduced from 25% to 18% of screen height

## [0.2.8] â€” 2025-07-27

### Added
- Offline species data bundle: 5,241 species images (240Ã—160 WebP) and descriptions in 7 languages bundled into the APK
- `tools/build_species_bundle.py` â€” re-runnable Python build script to download, resize, and package species assets
- `SpeciesDescriptionService` â€” lazy gzip JSON loader with per-locale caching and English fallback
- Italian (`it`) and Korean (`ko`) common name columns added to `taxonomy.csv`

### Changed
- All species images now load from bundled assets instead of network (CachedNetworkImage â†’ Image.asset)
- Species detail overlay uses bundled descriptions instead of taxonomy API fetch
- `TaxonomyService` is now fully offline â€” removed `fetchDetail()` and API cache

## [0.2.7] â€” 2025-07-27

### Added
- French (fr), Spanish (es), Czech (cs), Brazilian Portuguese (pt), and Italian (it) translations (~290 keys each)
- Language picker in settings expanded from 3 to 8 options (System, English, Deutsch, FranÃ§ais, EspaÃ±ol, ÄŒeÅ¡tina, PortuguÃªs, Italiano)

- German technical term consistency: Point Count, Survey, and Session kept in English across the German UI

### Changed
- Home screen footer: single `Wrap` with all 5 buttons replacing two-row layout
- Mode card descriptions rewritten as action-oriented phrases (English + German)
- Help text updated to be taxonomically agnostic ("species" instead of "bird species", "animal sounds" instead of "birdsong")

## [0.2.6] â€” 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- GPS jitter filtering: reject fixes with >30 m horizontal accuracy, speed gate (>30 km/h) discards teleport jumps, jitter threshold raised from 3 m to 5 m

### Changed

## [0.2.5] â€” 2026-04-13

### Added
- Microphone input selector in survey setup wizard (Parameters step) â€” pick input device before starting a survey
- Survey summary tab now shows rank numbers and sorts species by detection count then max confidence as tiebreaker

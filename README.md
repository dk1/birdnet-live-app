## Install on Android

BirdNET Live is available as a signed APK for sideloading. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/birdnet-team/birdnet-live-app/releases/latest), transfer the `.apk` file to your phone, and open it to install. You may need to allow installation from unknown sources in your device settings.

> **Note:** The APK is ~253 MB because it includes the full BirdNET+ audio model (~152 MB) for offline inference.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (3.27+ with Dart 3.7+)
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) for the large ONNX model files
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android SDK & emulator)
- Xcode (macOS only, for iOS development)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/birdnet-team/birdnet-live-app.git
cd birdnet-live-app
git lfs install
git lfs pull
flutter pub get
flutter gen-l10n
```

Do not skip the LFS step on a fresh clone. The two `.onnx` model files under `assets/models/` are stored with Git LFS; without the real files the app may build from pointer files but model loading will fail at runtime. You only need to run the Python model build pipeline in `dev/` when updating or rebuilding the models themselves.

### Verify

```bash
flutter doctor    # Check Flutter setup
flutter test      # Run tests
flutter analyze   # Check for issues
```

## Deploy to Phone

### Android (USB — Windows / macOS / Linux)

1. **Enable Developer Options** on your phone: Settings → About phone → tap "Build number" 7 times.
2. **Enable USB debugging**: Settings → Developer options → USB debugging → On.
3. **Connect** phone via USB and accept the debugging prompt.
4. **Check** Flutter sees the device:
   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```
5. **Run** (debug mode with hot reload):
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   Or press `F5` in VS Code with the Flutter extension installed.

6. **Build release APK** (optional):
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```
   The APK will be at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`. It is self-contained for sideloading and includes the ONNX models. Transfer it to your phone and install.

### Android (Wireless — Windows)

1. Complete steps 1–3 above (USB debugging on, phone connected via USB).
2. **Pair** over Wi-Fi (Android 11+):
   ```bash
   # On the phone: Developer options → Wireless debugging → Pair device with pairing code
   # Note the IP:port and pairing code shown
   adb pair <ip>:<port>
   # Enter the pairing code when prompted
   ```
3. **Connect** wirelessly:
   ```bash
   adb connect <ip>:<port>
   # Use the port shown under "Wireless debugging" (not the pairing port)
   ```
4. **Unplug** the USB cable. Run as usual:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### iOS (macOS only)

1. **Connect** iPhone via USB.
2. **Trust** the computer on the phone when prompted.
3. **Open** `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and set your signing team under Signing & Capabilities.
4. **Run**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   Or press `F5` in VS Code.

### VS Code Tips

- Install the **Flutter** and **Dart** extensions.
- Select your target device in the status bar (bottom-right).
- `F5` to launch with debugger attached.
- `Ctrl+F5` to launch without debugger (faster startup).
- Use the hot reload button (⚡) or `r` in the terminal for quick iterations.
- `R` in the terminal for hot restart (resets state).

```

## Model Assets

BirdNET Live runs fully on-device, so the model assets are part of the checkout/build rather than downloaded by the app at runtime. The large `.onnx` files in `assets/models/` are tracked with Git LFS:

- `BirdNET+_V3.0-preview3_Global_5K-pruned_FP16.onnx` — audio classifier (~152 MB)
- `BirdNET+_Geomodel_V3.0.1_Global_5K-pruned_FP16.onnx` — location-based species model (~6 MB)

Release APKs for sideloading keep those models inside `flutter_assets`. Play Store App Bundles move the `.onnx` files into the install-time `models_pack` asset pack so the base module stays below Play's size limit while still working offline after installation.

## Development

```bash
flutter run          # Run with hot reload
flutter test         # Run tests
flutter analyze      # Static analysis
dart format .        # Format code
```

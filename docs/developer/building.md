# Building

Build instructions for Android, iOS, and Windows.

## Android

```bash
# Debug APK
flutter build apk --debug

# Release APK
flutter build apk --release

# App Bundle (for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```

The release APK is written to `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.
It is self-contained for sideloading and bundles the ONNX models in `flutter_assets`.

For Play Store releases, use the app bundle. During AAB builds, the `.onnx` files are moved into the install-time `models_pack` asset pack so the base module stays below Google Play's size limit while the installed app still works offline.

The local release helper wraps the Play Store build and copies the AAB, mapping file, symbols, and release-note stubs into `release/<version>/`:

```bash
dart dev/build_release.dart
```

## iOS

Requires macOS with Xcode 15+:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
flutter build ios --release
```

Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode for archive and distribution.

## Windows

Requires Visual Studio 2022 with C++ desktop workload:

```bash
flutter build windows --release
```

## Notes

- The two ONNX models are tracked with Git LFS. Run `git lfs pull` before building from a fresh clone.
- APK builds keep the models in `flutter_assets`; AAB builds ship them via the install-time `models_pack` asset pack.
- ONNX Runtime native libraries are platform-specific and handled by the `flutter_onnxruntime` package.

## Forking and Re-releasing

The [Acceptable Use Policy](https://github.com/birdnet-team/birdnet-live-app/blob/main/ACCEPTABLE_USE.md) asks forks and redistributed versions to use distinct naming and branding unless explicit written permission has been granted. If you fork the project for your own distribution, you **must** change the app identity in all of the following places:

**Android** — `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId = "com.yourorg.yourapp"   // replace de.tu_chemnitz.mi.kahst.birdnet_live
    }
}
```

**iOS** — update the bundle identifier in Xcode:  
Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` → select the **Runner** target → **Signing & Capabilities** → change **Bundle Identifier** from `com.birdnet.birdnetLive` to your own identifier. Alternatively, edit `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` directly in `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.

Also update the app name shown to users:

- **Android**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` — `android:label`
- **iOS**: `ios/Runner/Info.plist` — `CFBundleDisplayName`
- **Flutter**: `pubspec.yaml` — `name` field (Dart package name, lowercase with underscores)

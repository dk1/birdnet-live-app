# BirdNET Live

**Professional bioacoustics in your pocket.**

BirdNET Live is a Flutter app built for field researchers, conservationists, and birders who need dependable acoustic evidence in the field. It runs the BirdNET+ audio classifier and geo-model directly on your device, so species identification works offline after installation.

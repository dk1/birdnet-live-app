## Explore and Species Symbols

| Monthly labels (`Jan`, `Apr`, `Jul`, `Oct`, `Dec`) | Reference points on the weekly expected-frequency chart in the species overlay. |

## Per-Detection Actions

These controls appear on every detection row across the app — Session Review species list, the clip player sheet, the live survey detection list, and survey map markers. See [Session Review → Per-detection actions](session-review.md#per-detection-actions) for the full behavior.

| Control | Meaning |
|---|---|
| :material-check: **Confirm** | One-tap checkmark that flags a detection as visually or acoustically verified. Confirmed detections gain a small green check on cluster rows and map markers. |
| :material-dots-vertical: **More** | Opens the per-detection overflow with **Share detection**, **Replace species**, **Delete detection**, and **Delete species**. |
| :material-share-variant: **Share detection** | Shares one detection through the platform share sheet, attaching the audio clip whenever one is available — including a slice of the in-progress recording during a live survey. |
| :material-swap-horizontal: **Replace species** | Pick a different species for this detection. Also opens by swiping a review row to the left. |
| :material-delete-outline: **Delete detection** | Removes the row immediately. An undo SnackBar appears for a few seconds. Also triggered by swiping a review row to the right. |
| :material-delete-sweep-outline: **Delete species** | Removes every detection of that species from the session in one shot, with the same SnackBar undo. |

| :material-share-variant: **Share** | Export or share the session. |
| :material-delete-outline: **Delete** | Discard the session. |
| :material-play: **Continue** | Continue an unfinished survey from Session Review when that action is available. |

## Screen-Specific Status Bars

### Live Mode

The Live info bar uses :material-information-outline: followed by compact labels such as:

- `now` — detections currently visible in the live list
- `spp` — unique species count
- `det` — total detections
- duration and estimated recording size when recording is active

### Point Count

The point-count timer bar combines :material-stop: **Stop**, :material-timer: **Timer**, and a progress bar to show the remaining timed session.

### Survey

The survey dashboard uses:

- :material-map-outline: **Map** — live map tab
- :material-equalizer: **Spectrogram** — spectrogram tab
- :material-chart-bar: **Summary** — summary tab
- :material-chart-bar: stats labels in the survey summary view

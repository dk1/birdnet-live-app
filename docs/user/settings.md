# Settings

BirdNET Live reuses one Settings screen across multiple workflows. The :material-tune: button opens the sections that are relevant to the screen you came from.

## How Settings Scope Works

- Opening Settings from Home shows the full screen.
- Opening Settings from Live, Survey, Point Count, or File Analysis filters the screen to the relevant sections.

## General

### Theme

Choose **Dark**, **Light**, or **System**.

### App Language

Sets the interface language.

### Species Names

Controls the language used for species names. **Follow app language** uses the same language as the interface when that name is available.

### Show scientific names

Shows scientific names below common names across the app.

### Timestamp display

Controls how per-detection times appear in session review.

- **Relative** shows the offset from the start of the recording, e.g. `00:12:34`. Best for reviewing a single session and matching the spectrogram playhead.
- **Absolute** shows the local clock time when the detection was captured, e.g. `08:42:17`. Best for cross-referencing field notes, weather logs, or simultaneous recordings.

If a detection lands on a different calendar day from the session start (e.g. an overnight survey), the absolute time gains a `+1d` suffix so reviewers don't accidentally read tomorrow's dawn chorus as today's.

When **Absolute** is selected, an additional **Show seconds in timestamps** toggle appears. Disable it if you prefer the more compact `08:42` over `08:42:17` — useful when scanning long detection lists. Relative offsets always show seconds because reviewers need sub-minute precision to align with the spectrogram playhead.

Storage and exports always use UTC instants regardless of this setting, so the choice never affects the data — only the way it's displayed.

## Audio

These controls appear in audio-driven live workflows.

### Gain

Adjusts the input gain shown in the app. Use this only when you need to compensate for very quiet recordings or inputs.

### High-pass filter (Hz)

Reduces low-frequency rumble before inference.

### Microphone

Lets you choose a specific input device or keep the **System default**.

## Inference

### Window duration

Controls the length of the analysis window.

### Confidence threshold

Sets how conservative detections should be.

### Sensitivity

Higher values make the detector more permissive, which can recover fainter calls at the cost of more false positives.

### Inference rate

Controls how frequently BirdNET runs inference.

### Score pooling

Controls how overlapping analysis windows are combined.

### Pooling window count

Controls how many consecutive inference windows participate in score pooling.
A larger value smooths each species' score over a longer time horizon, which
suppresses spurious one-off detections — useful for steady, distant calls
where you'd rather wait for a few corroborating windows before raising a
detection. A smaller value reacts faster to brief vocalizations but lets
through more noise. The default of **5** matches the value historically
hard-coded into the model and is a sensible starting point for live use.

## Spectrogram

### FFT size

Controls frequency resolution in the spectrogram.

### Color map

Choose **Viridis**, **Magma**, or **Grayscale**.

### Duration (scroll speed)

Controls how much time is visible in the spectrogram window.

### Frequency range

Sets the upper display frequency.

### Log amplitude

Applies logarithmic scaling to the spectrogram for easier visual reading.

## Recording

### Mode

- **Full** — save the whole recording
- **Detections only** — save clips around detections
- **Off** — no audio recording

### Clip context

When **Detections only** is active, the app shows a single **Clip context** slider (0–5 s) that sets how much audio is preserved on **both sides** of each detection. Each clip is `analysis window + 2 × clip context` long, so with a 3 s analysis window and the default 1 s context the saved clip is 5 s. Setting the context to 2 s yields a 7 s clip (2 s pre-roll + 3 s analyzed audio + 2 s post-roll). Larger values give you more room for visual inspection or external review tools at the cost of disk space; 0 saves only the analyzed window itself.

### Format

Choose **WAV** or **FLAC**.

### Auto-start recording (Live mode only)

When enabled, Live mode begins recording as soon as the screen opens and the model finishes loading — no need to tap the microphone button. Useful for kiosk-style deployments, hands-free use (e.g. mounting the device in the field), or any workflow where the user already knows that opening Live always means "start now". Disabled by default so an accidental tap on the Live tile from the home screen does not silently begin a session. The auto-start fires only once per screen visit, so stopping a session and tapping the mic again still works as a manual restart.

## Location

### Use GPS

Use device GPS instead of manual coordinates.

### Latitude / Longitude

Manual coordinates used when GPS is disabled.

### Refresh GPS now

Forces a fresh location fix instead of reusing the last value the app cached. The intuition: GPS lookups are cached per-screen so a setup screen does not block waiting for a satellite fix on every open, but that cache can be miles out of date if you have driven to a new spot since the last session. Tap this when you have moved and want the geo-filter to use *here*, not where you started the morning. The current cached coordinates are shown in the subtitle so you can verify what the app thinks your location is. If GPS cannot get a fix within ~10 seconds, the app falls back to the OS-provided last-known location and warns you with a snackbar so you know the value is stale.

### Species filter

- **Off** — no geographic filtering
- **Location filter** — exclude species that fall below the geographic threshold
- **Location weighting** — use the geo-model as an additional weighting signal

### Geo-filter threshold

Appears when a location-based filter mode is active.

## Export & Sync

### Format

Choose one export target:

- Raven Selection Table
- CSV
- JSON
- GPX (track + waypoints)

### Include audio files

Include saved audio alongside the exported tables or metadata when supported by the export workflow.

## About

The **About** row opens the in-app About screen.

## Danger Zone

### Reset Onboarding

Shows the onboarding sequence again the next time the app launches.

### Clear All Data

Opens a confirmation flow for permanently removing stored app data.

## Workflow-Specific Parameters Outside Settings

Some parameters are configured inside their own setup screens rather than in the shared Settings screen.

- [Point Count Mode](point-count-mode.md) has its own duration and location setup.
- [Survey Mode](survey-mode.md) has its own survey parameters screen.
- [File Analysis](file-analysis.md) has its own analysis-parameter step.

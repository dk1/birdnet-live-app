// ARU Detection Sampler - Clip retention across scheduled cycles
// =============================================================================

import '../live/live_session.dart';

/// Chooses which ARU detection clips remain on disk.
///
/// Detection records are always retained. This sampler only clears
/// [DetectionRecord.audioClipPath] and deletes the clip file when retention
/// limits require a clip to be dropped.
///
/// Selection mirrors the Survey [DetectionSampler] exactly — Top N
/// highest-confidence clips per species, with a Smart mode that adds same-spot
/// rivalry once all topN slots are filled — with one deliberate difference:
/// ARU deployments are stationary, so the Survey "same spot" test reduces to a
/// **time-only** proximity check (no haversine distance). Two detections of the
/// same species within [timeThresholdSeconds] are treated as the same
/// continuous vocalization, so only the strongest clip survives. This spreads
/// retained clips across a long deployment instead of clustering them on one
/// chatty bird in one short span.
///
/// Clip-file teardown is shared with the Survey sampler via
/// [deleteDetectionClipFile]. ARU additionally keys retention by an optional
/// [scopeKeyFor] (e.g. one budget per cycle when each cycle becomes its own
/// session) and supports mid-session [replaceRecord], since ARU detections are
/// re-synced from the live inference loop as immutable records.

// =============================================================================
// Global Species History — Lifetime list of every species ever detected
// =============================================================================
//
// Tracks the set of scientific names that have ever appeared in *any*
// session recorded by this app on this device. Used by the Survey species
// alert engine in "first-ever" mode to fire a notification only when a
// detection is genuinely new across the user's entire history (i.e., a new
// life-list species).
//
// ### Storage
//
// One JSON-encoded list of strings under the SharedPreferences key
// [PrefKeys.globalSpeciesHistory]. The set is small (~5 k species max,
// typically far fewer) so a single key works fine — no need for a database.
//
// ### Backfill
//
// On first launch of v0.7.0 the set is empty. We seed it once by scanning
// every persisted session via [SessionRepository.listAll] and collecting
// the distinct scientific names. The completion is recorded under
// [PrefKeys.globalSpeciesHistorySeeded] so we never re-scan.
//
// Backfill is idempotent and cheap (sessions are JSON files), but for very
// large libraries (hundreds of sessions) it is run off the critical path
// at app startup, after the first frame.

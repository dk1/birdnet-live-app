// =============================================================================
// Detection Sampler — Controls which survey detection clips are kept on disk
// =============================================================================
//
// On a multi-hour survey the detection *records* themselves are cheap (a few
// hundred bytes each) — we always keep every merged detection in the session
// so the user has a complete log. What is expensive is the per-detection WAV
// clip on disk. The sampler decides which clips survive; the records remain.
//
// Three modes operate on **merged detections** (one record per continuous
// appearance, closed when the species disappears or the session ends):
//
//   * **All** — keep every clip. The sampler is a no-op.
//   * **Top N** — keep the N highest-confidence clips per species. When a
//     better detection arrives, the weakest's clip is deleted (its record
//     stays, with `audioClipPath` cleared). When a new detection is worse
//     than the weakest existing clip, the new one's clip is dropped on
//     arrival.
//   * **Smart** — same per-species cap of N, but with spatial distribution.
//     If a new detection lands at the same "spot" as an already-kept clip
//     (within distance + time thresholds: 250 m **or** 2 min), only the
//     higher-confidence clip survives — even if there's still a free slot.
//     This prevents one stationary singer from grabbing all N slots.
//
//     A floor of [minKeepPerSpecies] (default 3) clips per species is
//     always honored: until that many clips are retained for a species,
//     same-spot rivalry is bypassed and clips are admitted via the normal
//     Top N path. This guarantees a few representative recordings even for
//     birds that only call from one spot.
//
// Records always live in the session. Only `audioClipPath` is affected.

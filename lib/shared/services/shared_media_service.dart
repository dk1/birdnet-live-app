// =============================================================================
// Shared Media Service — "Share with BirdNET Live" → File Analysis
// =============================================================================
//
// Bridges an audio file handed to the app by another app to Dart:
//
//   * Android — an ACTION_SEND (share sheet) or ACTION_VIEW ("open with")
//     intent carrying an `audio/*` URI. See the intent filters in
//     AndroidManifest.xml and `captureSharedMedia` in MainActivity.kt.
//   * iOS — a document opened through CFBundleDocumentTypes, which covers both
//     the share sheet and Files' "Open With". AppDelegate.swift queues it. See
//     docs/developer/share-targets.md.
//
// Both platforms queue the incoming item natively and either forward it
// immediately (app already running — "warm" case) or hold it for
// [takePendingSharedFile] once Dart starts listening (app was killed — "cold"
// case). Mirrors `quick_action_service.dart`'s native-action bridge.
//
// The hand-off is deliberately two calls. The URI arrives instantly, so File
// Analysis can open on it; the copy into app storage — which for a long
// recording is hundreds of megabytes — runs afterwards under that screen's own
// progress indicator.
